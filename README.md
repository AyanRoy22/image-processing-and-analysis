# Image-processing-and-analysis-using-Machine-Leaning
The name of the project is Image Processing and Analysis using Machine Learning. 
In this project I have used Image Processing techniques to analyse a sample image and identify the prominent colours in the image.
I have used the pixels of the image along with its RGB values as the dataset and visualized the top 5 colours in the image with the help of a pie plot.
